# GIT
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system created by *Linux Torvalds* and designed to handle from small to very large projects

It's basically a software for us developers to control and manage our apps & projects

## Forking
Forking a github repository provides a **copy of a repository** in an user's account

Forking is made for *improving* someone's code/software and *reusing* the code in a project (why to reivent the wheel?)
#### Steps
1. Fork a repository
2. Code changes
3. Send changes to the original repository, **Pull Request**

## Pull Request
When we push our changes, those changes are sent to an x branch

The *pull request* first makes a pull to master branch
Because it's sending the changes to that branch.

Only a few users have permissions for *master branch*, in order to validate or reject changes on that branch
