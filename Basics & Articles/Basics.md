# Basics

Computer science is the subject that studies what computers can do.


### Brief history of Theoretical Computer Science
Starts with Alan Turing who formalized the concept of a Turing Machine. A simple description of a general purpose computer.
It's the foundation of the computer science. It contains several parts:

- An infinitely long tape, that is split into cells containing simbols: 0, 1 (electricity, no electricity)
- A head that can read and write symbols to the tape
- A state register that stores the state of the head and a list os possible instructions

In todays computers, **the tape is the working memory or RAM**. **The head is the CPU** (Central Processing Unit) and **the list of instructions is held in the computer's memory**.
This is essentially what all computers do nowadays.

Every problem that is computable by a Turing machine is computable using Lambda calculus, which is the basis of research in programming languages.


### Algorithms
An algorithm is a set of instructions independent of the hardware or programming language, designed to solve a particular problem.
It's like a recipe of how to build a program. A lot of work is put into developing algorithms to get the best out of computers.

Some algorithms are much more efficient than others. This is studied in **Algorithmic Complexity** and **Analysis of Algorithms**.

Other fields of the theoretical computers science are **Computability Theory**, **Computational Complexity**, **Information Theory**, **Cryptography**, **Logic**, **Graph Theory**, **Automata Theory**, **Quantum Computation**, **Paralel Programming**, **Formal Methods**, **Data Structures**.


### Software Engineering
Code is a bunch of instructions telling the computer what to do.
Good code is vital, it must be as efficient as possible and as free of errors as possible.

Therefore, there are many best practices and designing philosophies to follow, such as **Object Oriented Design**, **Formal Methods**, **Unit Testing** and **Version Control**.
