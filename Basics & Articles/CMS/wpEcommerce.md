## Most recommended ecommerce combo, Wordpress & Woocommerce
## Important to check themes & hostings recommended for Woocommerce

## Wordpress / Woocommerce vs Shopify
> As long as you don't have more than 50k products I would recommend Shopify. The biggest reason for me is that way you don't have to deal with quarterly scans for PCI-DSS compliance. Shopify is a tier 1 provider, so you don't have to pay for that scan and don't have to worry about the latest zero-day exploit in WordPress or one of the plugins you are using.

> For the long term, WooCommerce is absolutely better than Shopify for its customization and a large number of plugins. However, you’re new to eCommerce or you don’t want to bother about technical details, go for Shopify. Also, if you’re looking to test things and try a few products, try out Shopify's 14-day free trial now to see how it works.


## About Plugins and Payment Gateways
Most ecommerce plugins offer the functionality of a cart within your site and connect to a payment gateways.

What payment gateway you choose is separate from the plugin. For example, WP ecommerce and eshop can both use paypal to process payments, but have different features and look/operate differently. You should choose a plugin that offers the features you need.
