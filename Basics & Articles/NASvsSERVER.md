# NAS & Servers

## NAS

**NAS** may refer either to

**Network Access Server**, NAS is a terminal server that connects to and communicates with another computer or service

**Network-Attached Storage**, NAS is any storage service that is connected to a network and provides a network with additional storage
It usually uses the TCP/IP protocol

**NAS** became a popular solution for multiple purposes
It's easy to install and config and allows to install multiple apps such as:

- Web server functionality
- Video surveillance cameras system
- Backup photos on the cloud
- Watch tv shows and films on streaming
- Support email systems or accounting databases
- Data logging
- Business analytics

*It could be defined as a network's hard disk that allows with multiple and powerful functions*

It's a device that is specialized to provide data storage and make it easily accesible
A NAS provides a central location to allow for synced folders that can be accessed and modified by others on the network
It's also useful for backing up data, file storage and sharing

NAS devices offer many of the same services that an application server can, but with more basic settings and less customization
One of the key reasons to select NAS is the cost, which is much more cheaper and consumes much less resources


#### Some benefits of NAS over a Server
- Simple to operate, it doesn't require a dedicated IT proffesional
- Lower cost, can significantly reduce wasted space
- Easy data backup and recovery
- Centralization of data storage in a safe, reliable way for authorised network users and clients
- Supports a large variety of applications
- Permits data access across the network, including cloud based applications and data



## Server

Server works as a generic concept, because any computer with proper config could work as a server
But a server itself, brings a different purpose, it's main role would be manage resources and clients on the network
Among the potential server capabilities:

- Active directory domain controller (Authenticates and authorizes all users and computers on the network)
- DHCP Server - Dynamically assigns IP addresses to devices on the network
- DNS Server - associates IP addresses with domain names
- Printing and Document Services
- File stotage, sharing and collaboration tools
- User or Device Specific Permissions
- Applications - applications installed on server that are accesible to clients (accounting software, e-commerce, software)

It also allows much more powerful functions than a NAS
While NAS is easier and  cheaper than a server, it's recommended for user with less experience
Servers are the ideal choice for expert users
