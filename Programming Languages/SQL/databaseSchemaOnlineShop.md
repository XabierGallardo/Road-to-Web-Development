# Database Schema example for an online shop
Designing a database schema for an online merchandise store involves several components to manage products, customers, orders, and other related information. Below is a basic outline of tables and their relationships for such a database:

1. **Products Table:**
   - `product_id` (Primary Key)
   - `name`
   - `description`
   - `price`
   - `stock_quantity`
   - `category_id` (Foreign Key to Category Table)
   - `created_at`
   - `updated_at`

2. **Categories Table:**
   - `category_id` (Primary Key)
   - `name`

3. **Customers Table:**
   - `customer_id` (Primary Key)
   - `first_name`
   - `last_name`
   - `email`
   - `password_hash`
   - `address`
   - `created_at`
   - `updated_at`

4. **Orders Table:**
   - `order_id` (Primary Key)
   - `customer_id` (Foreign Key to Customers Table)
   - `order_date`
   - `total_amount`

5. **Order_Items Table:**
   - `order_item_id` (Primary Key)
   - `order_id` (Foreign Key to Orders Table)
   - `product_id` (Foreign Key to Products Table)
   - `quantity`
   - `unit_price`

6. **Payments Table:**
   - `payment_id` (Primary Key)
   - `order_id` (Foreign Key to Orders Table)
   - `payment_date`
   - `amount`
   - `payment_method`

This schema provides a foundation for managing products, categories, customers, orders, order items, and payments. You can expand upon this schema based on your specific requirements, such as adding tables for reviews, ratings, shipping information, etc. Additionally, you may need to incorporate indexes, constraints, and other optimizations based on the database management system you are using (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
