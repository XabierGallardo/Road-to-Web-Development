# What is BASH?
Bash is **a command language interpreter** for interacting with a computer from the command line.

It's also called a shell because it surrounds the Operative System's kernel to hide its intrincate details while allows the programmer to do important stuff like access data and write files by tiping simple commands.

But Bash is also **a Programming Language** specialized on UNIX/Linux shell scripting. 
It's the default command shell on UNIX systems. It's Turing complete, which means it's possible to write any program in BASH.

Bash allows us to write scrips, which means that anything we type manually in the command line can be automated with code.

## What's this thing called Terminal?
The terminal window contains shell, and shell allows you by use of commands to interact with your computer, hence retrieve or store data, process information and various other simple or even extremely complex tasks.

## What is Scripting
Scripting comes when you need to automate the execution of commands.
By use of scripting, any shell interaction can be automated and scripted.

## Script permissions and execution
To make *hello_world.sh* executable
```sh
chmod 755 hello_world.sh
```

To execute *hello_world.sh*
```sh
./hello_world.sh
or
bash hello_world.sh
```
