## What is Pyton?
Python is an open-source general-purpose programming language that runs on allmost all system architectures and can be used for a wide range of applications, from web development, data science to machine learning.

On top of its versatility, the language is also beginner-friendly. As a general-purpose language you can build pretty much anything with Python:

- Simple scripts fro automating workflows
- Web scrapers to harvest internet data
- Standalone binaries (i.e, apps) using Py Installer
- High-powered web apps and REST APIs using Flask or Django
- Machine learning programs and Artificial Inteligence
- Glue code that connects software in different languages
- Trading apps that manage money
- Open-source software development


## What can Python do?
- Python can be used on a server to create web applications
- Python can be used alongsinde software to create workflows
- Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files
- Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics
- Python can be used for rapid prototyping or production-ready software development

Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it's written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.

Also Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.


## Python in Web Development
Python is a back-end programming language. Web developers can use Python to transfer data to and from servers, interact with databases and manage a site's security.

There are many Python frameworks often used in web development:
- **Django**: An open-source, high level and Python-based web framework for rapid development of secure websites with clean design.
- **Flask**: A microframework written in Python to provide a simple but extensible core, with little to no dependencies or external libraries.
- **CherryPy**: Known for its simplicity, CherryPy lets developers build web application using object-oriented programming, producing smaller source code in less time.
- **web2py**: A free full-stack framework grate for developing portable database-driven web applications


## Automation and System Scripting
**Automation** refers to making computers or machines compelte tasks without human intervention. Meanwhile **scripting** refers to writing code to create the automated system.

As an scripting language, Python can be used to automate various tasks for both programmers and non programmers. Some examples of the task the *automation scripts* can perform are:

- Solving simple math problems
- Checking for errors and duplicate in files
- Renaming or converting files
- Entering data into an Excel spreadsheet
- Sending HTTP requests
- Calculating exchange rates
- Downloading content
- Sorting, sending and replying to texts and emails
- Scraping data from websites


## Software Testing
One of the most important parts of developing software is the quality asurance process. While software companies must ensure their product offers a high-quality, consistent and smooth user experienice, they also have to release their software and updates quickly and efficiently. This is where **test automation** comes in.

Automated testing or test automation means using computers to run tests, manage test data and analyze test results automatically to improve software quality.

Test automation is great for repetitive tasks, such as regression and functional testing. Python's versatility, scalability and popularity make it ideal for bulding test automation solutions for developing software.

- **Selenium**: A suite for various tools and modules for facilitating browser automation. It provides a single interface for writing test scripts in multiple languages, including Python.


## Data Analysis & Machine Learning
Python has become an integral part of data science and AI since the language is easy to learn, versatile and flexible.

Scientist and analysts use Python code to mine big data, build machine learning algorithms, manipulate and analyze data, and perform complex statistical calculations.

The Python language also has a vast collection of libraries useful for data anylisis and machine learning:

- NumPy: Short for Numerical Python, this open-source library supports multi-dimensional arrays and matrices and provides various routines for mathematical operations on arrays.
- TensorFlow: A Python library for developing and training machine-learning models using high-level APIs. It can run deep neural networks for various purposes, such as image recognition and natural language processing.
- PyTorch: A machine-learning library for Python based on Torch. It is primarily used in deep learning research.
- Scrapy: An open-source Python framework for crawling websites and extracting structured data from their pages.
