# Visual Studio Config & Basics

## Auto Format / Indentation
Keyboard Shortcut to manual indentation
Select the text to fix with the keyboard or cursor
**Alt + Shift + F**

Instead of doing manual indentation, we can automate this process
1. Config -> Settings
2. Text Editor -> Formatting
3. Select Format On Paste to automatically format the pasted content
4. Select Format On Save to automatically format the code everytime we type *Ctrl+S* or File -> Save

Another option for languages that don't have a native support from visual studio is using Extensions like **Prettier** and **Linter**



## Themes
My favourite one is Dracula theme
https://draculatheme.com/visual-studio-code/

1. View -> Command Pallette
2. Write Install Extension and Enter
3. Write Dracula Official and Enter
